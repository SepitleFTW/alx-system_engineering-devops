SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows remote access through an encrypted connection123. It uses cryptography to authenticate and encrypt connections between devices1. SSH applications are based on a clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server2. SSH also allows for tunneling, or port forwarding, which is when data packets are able to cross networks that they would not otherwise be able to cross1. SSH is used in nearly every data center and in every large enterprise4.
