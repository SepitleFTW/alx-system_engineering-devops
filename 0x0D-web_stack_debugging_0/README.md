**Web Stack Debugging #0** was the first in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these projects, participants were given broken or bugged web stacks in isolated containers and tasked with fixing them to a working state. For this specific task, the goal was to create a **Bash script** that would run **Apache** on a web server and get it to respond to queries to the root. The script aimed to address the issue and restore the web stack's functionality.

The ability to debug a web stack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and practice is key to mastering it. Debugging broken webstacks allows engineers to gain valuable experience in troubleshooting and problem-solving. By analyzing the issues and creating automated scripts, they learn how to bring web applications back to a functional state.

In summary, **Web Stack Debugging #0** involved fixing a broken web stack by creating a Bash script to make Apache respond to root queries. It was the first step in a series of debugging challenges. ðŸš€
