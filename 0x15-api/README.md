A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating scalable and efficient web services. It operates over HTTP protocols, utilizing standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and fulfill it, without relying on previous interactions. They use uniform resource identifiers (URIs) to identify resources and provide a standardized way for clients to interact with them. REST APIs are widely used in modern web development due to their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with various platforms and devices.
