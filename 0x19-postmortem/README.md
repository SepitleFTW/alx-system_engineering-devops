On April 10, 2024, I started a backend project using Django because it's popular and has many features. However, by April 14, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, I had to switch to Flask because Django caused many delays and issues, affecting our timeline and productivity. I struggled with Django's setup and database connections, spending a lot of time fixing these problems. Even after trying to optimize settings, I faced performance issues and difficulties with third-party integrations. I realized that Django was too complex for our needs and added unnecessary complications. After discussing with the team, we evaluated Flask and found it simpler and better suited for our project. We switched to Flask, creating a new project setup and rewriting the code, which solved our problems and made development smoother. To avoid similar issues in the future, I plan to improve our process for choosing frameworks, provide better training for the team, test frameworks before fully committing, and document what we learned. These steps will help us choose the right tools and work more efficiently in future projects.
